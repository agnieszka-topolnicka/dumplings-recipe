# Dumpling Recipe

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide to making delicious homemade dumplings, including ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and a UML model of the preparation process.

## Ingredients

### For the Dough
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup warm water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### For the Filling
- 1 pound ground pork (or substitute with chicken, beef, or vegetables)
- 2 cups finely chopped Napa cabbage
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon white pepper

### For the Dipping Sauce
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon chili oil (optional)
- 1 green onion, finely chopped

## Instructions

### Prepare the Dough
1. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt
2. Gradually add warm water while stirring to form a shaggy dough
3. Knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic
4. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 30 minutes

### Prepare the Filling
1. If using cabbage, sprinkle with salt and let sit for 15 minutes to draw out moisture
2. Squeeze excess moisture from cabbage
3. Combine all filling ingredients in a large bowl
4. Mix thoroughly until well combined (mixture should be sticky)
5. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld

### Make the Dumplings
1. Divide dough into 4 equal portions
2. Roll each portion into a long rope and cut into 8-10 pieces
3. Roll each piece into a 3-inch round wrapper
4. Place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each wrapper
5. Fold and pleat edges to seal (see folding techniques below)

### Cooking Methods

#### Boiling
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil
2. Add dumplings carefully (don't overcrowd)
3. Stir gently to prevent sticking
4. When dumplings float to the surface, continue boiling for 3-4 minutes
5. Remove with a slotted spoon and serve immediately

#### Pan-Frying (Potstickers)
1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat
2. Place dumplings flat-side down in the pan
3. Cook until bottoms are golden brown (2-3 minutes)
4. Add 1/4 cup water to the pan and cover immediately
5. Steam until water evaporates (about 5 minutes)
6. Remove lid and cook for another minute to crisp up bottoms

#### Steaming
1. Line a steamer basket with cabbage leaves or parchment paper
2. Place dumplings in the basket, leaving space between each
3. Steam over boiling water for 8-10 minutes
4. Serve immediately

### Prepare the Dipping Sauce
1. Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl
2. Mix well and let sit for at least 10 minutes before serving

## Folding Techniques

### Basic Fold
1. Place filling in the center of the wrapper
2. Fold in half to form a half-moon shape
3. Press edges firmly to seal

### Pleated Fold
1. Place filling in the center of the wrapper
2. Fold in half, but only pinch together at the top
3. Create 3-5 pleats along one side, working toward the center
4. Repeat on the other side
5. Press edges firmly to seal

## Storage and Freezing
- Fresh uncooked dumplings can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours
- To freeze, place dumplings on a baking sheet without touching
- Freeze until solid (about 2 hours), then transfer to freezer bags
- Frozen dumplings can be stored for up to 3 months
- Cook frozen dumplings directly (do not thaw) with slightly longer cooking time

## Tips for Success
- Keep wrappers and prepared dumplings covered with a damp towel to prevent drying
- Don't overfill the dumplings or they may burst during cooking
- Make sure the edges are completely sealed to prevent filling from leaking
- If the dough is too sticky, add a small amount of flour
- If the dough is too dry, add a small amount of water

Enjoy your homemade dumplings!
